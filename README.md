# IZG-project
Brno University of Technology study project in Computer Graphics Principles (IZG) subject 

# Decription
Task is to implement a simple graphics card (gpu). Use gpu to visualize the rabbit model with phong lighting model and phong shading with
procedural texture. The aim of the project is to teach how today's graphics cards work and how to control these cards using the API 
(which is close to OpenGL). Each task is assigned an acceptance test, so it is easily to verify the functionality of implementation.

The task consists of two parts:

1. GPU implementation
2. Use of GPU to render a textured rabbit within the PhongMethod rendering method.
